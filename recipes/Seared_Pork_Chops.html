    <h1>Seared Pork Chops</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bursting with flavor and perfect for a light summer dinner, these Greek-inspired pork chops are anything but boring. The pork is well seasoned and the flavor is amplified through the caramelization that occurs during searing. The bright acidity is balanced out with salty, brininess from the olives and feta.</p>
